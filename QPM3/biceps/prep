# create experimental data for BICePs (1/ make sure atom_indice_noe.txt and noe_distance.txt are ready 2/ need pdbfile for topology information 3/ output file name need to be changed as xxx.noe (xxx is your system's name) 4/ this is very important since it will be read by BICePs to get exp data)

# set up BICePs calcualtion file (change line 49 "expdata_filename_noe =" your output file from last step)
vi sample.py

# set up MBAR estimator scripts (change line 59 "nstates" equal to number of states you have)
vi calc_MBAR_fromresults.py

# set up output plot scripts (shouldn't be changed in this case)
vi plot_results.py

# before you finally run BICePs make sure you have following files/folders ready:
# energy.txt (prior distribution)
# xxx.noe (exp data)
# NOE/rminus6_whole_state?.txt (model distances)
# pdb/state_?.pdb (pdb file for each state)
# make sure src/ is in the same directory as your work directory (source codes for BICePs)

# After checking everything, you are good to go to qsub qsub.sh file
